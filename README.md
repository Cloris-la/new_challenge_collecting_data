üîß Installation & Setup
Clone or download the project files

Install required dependencies

bash
pip install playwright beautifulsoup4 tqdm
Install Playwright browsers

bash
playwright install
üöÄ Usage
Phase 1: Extract Property URLs
Run the main script to collect property listing URLs:

bash
python all_url.py
This will:

Launch a browser window (set headless=True in code to run in background)

Navigate through search result pages

Extract all property listing URLs

Save unique URLs to zimmoweb_links.txt

Display progress with a visual progress bar

Phase 2: Extract Property Details
Uncomment and modify the extraction code in property_info_extractor.py to process the saved URLs:

python
# Uncomment and modify this section in property_info_extractor.py
with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    page = browser.new_page()

    # Read saved URLs
    with open("zimmoweb_links.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        urls = [line.strip() for line in f if line.strip()]

    # Write to CSV file
    with open("zimmoweb_data.csv", "w", newline="", encoding="utf-8") as csvfile:
        fieldnames = ["url", "locality", "price", "property_type"]
        writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)
        writer.writeheader()

        for i, url in enumerate(urls, 1):
            print(f"Processing property {i}")
            data = extract_info(page, url)
            writer.writerow(data)
    
    browser.close()
‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
Legal Compliance: Always review Zimmo.be's terms of service and robots.txt before scraping

Rate Limiting: The script includes delays between requests (2000-3000ms) to avoid overwhelming the server

Error Handling: The code includes try-catch blocks to handle potential extraction errors gracefully

Data Accuracy: Verify the CSS selectors regularly as website structure may change over time

üîç Customization
The script can be easily modified to:

Change search parameters: Modify the URL in all_url.py to target different property filters

Add new data fields: Update the extraction functions to capture additional property information

Adjust scraping speed: Modify the wait times between requests

Enable headless mode: Set headless=True for browser automation without a visible window

üìä Output Files
zimmoweb_links.txt: Contains all unique property URLs, one per line

zimmoweb_data.csv: Structured data containing all extracted property information
